# SneakerNet
Retraining mobilenet for classifying sneakers, with Tensorflow.
Jointly predicts both the brand and name of sneaker, from a collection of web-scraped images.

Data scraping code uses a fork of [this code](https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download)

A first personal foray into Tensorflow, still in progress.
